2) what is differnet in SQL And MySQL?
->i) SQL -> it stand for Structure Query Language. it is language.
ii) MySQL -> is Relational Database Management System that uses SQL for storing, retriving, modifying and administrating the database

3) method overriding and method overloading?
-> i) overloading - method overloading is called compile-time polymorphism. It occurs within the class. overloading is like user pass same value but get different output because the method. doesn't need inheritance
  eg. class math:
    def sum (val1,val2):
      return val1 + val2

    def sub(val1, val2):
      return val1 - val2

user1 = math()
print(user1.sum(3,2), user1,sub(3,2) -> o/p - 5 , 1

ii) overriding :- method overriding is called run-time polymorphism. it need two class and inheritance, overriding it overwrite the same method of parent into child class to get different answer. need inheritance
eg.
class animal:
  def leg():
    print('four')

class child(animal):
  def leg():
    ptint('two')

user1= child()
print(user1.leg()) -> o/p - two

4)getters and setters?
->the main purpose of using getters and setters in object-oriented programs is to ensure data encapsulation, getters & setters use to add validation logic around getting and setting a value.
